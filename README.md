## Overview

This project is an **Online Feedback Collection & Complaint Resolution** system. It enables users to submit feedback and complaints through web forms. The submissions are stored via Java/JSP backend and displayed for admin review so complaints can be managed/resolved.

Useful for organizations that want to streamline feedback from users/customers and ensure complaints are tracked and addressed.

---

## Features

- Feedback form where users can submit comments or suggestions (via `feedback_form.html` → backend submit JSP).  
- Complaint form for users to report issues (via `complaint_form.html` → backend JSP).  
- Styles are handled via `styles.css` for frontend look.  
- Backend implemented with JSP / Java to handle form submission, data processing, storage or initial handling.  
- Ability for admin or management to see submitted feedback/complaints (depending on code available).  
- Basic validation in frontend forms (required fields) and backend handling.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS |
| Backend | Java + JSP |
| Web Server / Container | (Use a compatible JSP/Servlet container e.g., Apache Tomcat) |
| Styles | CSS |
| Data Handling | Likely file storage or (if code extended) database—depends on implementation |

## Installation (local)

1. Set up a Java Servlet/JSP capable server (e.g., **Apache Tomcat**).  
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soniji5504/online-feedback-collection-and-complaint-resolution.git
   cd online-feedback-collection-and-complaint-resolution
Place the project folder into the webapps folder of Tomcat (or whatever directory your JSP container uses).

Start the server (Tomcat).

Open browser and go to:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/[project-folder]/feedback_form.html
and

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/[project-folder]/complaint_form.html
How to Use
User visits Feedback Form → fills in fields → clicks submit → data sent to submitFeedback.jsp.

User visits Complaint Form → fills in complaint details → submitted via submitComplaint.jsp.

Backend handles received data: store, log, or email forwarding (depending on the actual implementation).

Admin reviews stored feedback and complaints. (If there’s an admin panel or storage display code; if not, code can be extended to include that.)

Customization
Modify form fields in feedback_form.html or complaint_form.html for your organization's needs (add phone number, categories, attachments, etc.).

Update styles.css to change look & feel (colors, layout).

If not already, add persistence: integrate database (MySQL / PostgreSQL / other) instead of simple file-based or session-based storage.

Add email notifications to admin when a complaint or feedback is submitted.

Build an admin dashboard to list, filter, mark resolved complaints.

Troubleshooting
Issue	Possible Fix
Forms not submitting	Check that JSP container (Tomcat) is running; correct URL; that submit*.jsp is in correct folder and path matches form action.
Styling not loading	Ensure styles.css path is correct in HTML.
Backend errors (HTTP 500)	Check server logs; ensure JSP/servlet version compatibility; correct folder structure.
Character encoding / special characters issues	Ensure JSP pages are using correct charset (e.g., UTF-8); encode form data properly.

Security Best Practices
Sanitize user input (both client-side and server-side) to prevent XSS / injection attacks.

Validate form data (required fields, formats, length).

If storing feedback/complaints, protect access (admin pages should be authenticated).

If file uploads are allowed in future, validate file type/size and store securely.

Use HTTPS in production so data submission is encrypted.
